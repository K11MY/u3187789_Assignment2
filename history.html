              Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust
              of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building
              of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In
              1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the
              current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the
              building.

            <br />
            <p>
              The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition
              was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants
              as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of the
              original design included:

                  a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north
                  wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;

                <li>
                  he flat roof area of the east and south wings which was

                <li>
                  accommodation in the building included a board room, dining
                  room, reception area, bar and kitchen.

              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was
              officially opened on 14 April 1972.

            <p>
              Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged
              by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.

              Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect.
              Boyd was a member of a prominent artistic family, and combined a
              career as an architect, author and critic (Clerehan 1993). He was
              strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and deeply interested
              in the development of Australian architecture. Boyd is often
              remembered best for his domestic architecture, as well as his
              books, but he also produced designs for larger scale works, such
              as in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was awarded the Gold Medal
              by the RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow in 1970.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war
              concrete architecture produced in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). This
              Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College
              Student Housing (1968) and in the design for Churchill House. In
              this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects,
              although with only limited success.

              During the 1990s(?) the glass pavilion was replaced by the current
              north wing.

              Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed
              in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:
            </p>
            <div class="list">
              <ul>
                <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>
                <li>Cameron Offices, 1976;</li>
                <li>Canberra School of Music, 1976; and</li>

            <p>
              Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of
              only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been
              described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10),
              both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to
              the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a
              distinctive image in the national capital.
