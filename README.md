# u3187789_Assignment2 - Front End Web Design 

## Reflection
During this unit I was tasked to create my first responsive html and css page. Through using my inspiration board I have decided to create a one page scroll website for my main content. 

This decision was made because many users would be accessing the page via mobile or tablet devices. Having a one page scroll would come naturally the user becuase on social media people are used to seeing the content shown to them directly on the screen and a navigation bar. 

This decision also made it easier for me to design the website with the intent of simplicity and usability. I also intended for the index page to be a navigation type system for the user to navigate through the content. The ability to read the preview of the content rather than being splurged with content in one go can make the user feel like the content can be found to their needs and wants. 

### Challenges 

#### 1: Navbar Media Query 
This was one the most annoying parts of the website to code up and ensuring that the navigation bar could cater to all devices of different types and sizes. Finding a way to make the navgation bar fit all the content that was needed was difficult. Especially for a one page scroll on my description.html. I knew it would be a pain for the user to not have a navigation menu or bar of some sort for the user to navigate through the content. They would spend too much time scrolling up and down the page. It took me a few tries to finally come up with an idea that I enyjoed.  

#### Solution
I decided on mobile devices to create a 100vh navigation menu. When the user first lands on the page they are able to see all the different topics that are listed. As the user scrolls down a back to top button will appear for them to go all the back to the top where the navigation menu is and chose a different topic. For tablet I decided to remove the logo, make the text smaller so it would fit all the links and fixed so the user can access the navigation bar at any time. Although they still have the ability to use to return back to top arrow if they want.
