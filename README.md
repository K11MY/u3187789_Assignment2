## Reflection

### (Insert Mulan Reflection for background music)

Here is my reflection and my thought process throughout creating the website.

During this unit I was tasked to create my first responsive html and css page. Through using my inspiration board, I have decided to create a one page scroll website for my main content.

This decision was made because many users would be accessing the page via mobile or tablet devices. Having a one-page scroll would come naturally the user because on social media people are familiar to seeing the content shown to them directly on the screen and a navigation bar.

This decision also made it easier for me to design the website with the intent of simplicity and usability. I also intended for the index page to be a navigation type system for the user to navigate through the content. The ability to read the preview of the content rather than being splurged with content in one go can make the user feel like the content can be found to their needs and wants.

### Bumps on the Road (Challenges)

#### 1: Ugh, Navigation Responsiveness-sssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

Navigation media query was one the most annoying parts of the website to code up and ensuring that the navigation bar could cater to all devices of different types and sizes. Finding a way to make the navigation bar fit all the content that was needed was difficult. Especially for a one page scroll on my description.html. I knew it would be a pain for the user to not have a navigation menu or bar of some sort for the user to navigate through the content. They would spend too much time scrolling up and down the page. It took me a few tries to finally come up with an idea that I enjoyed.

#### Solution

I decided on mobile devices to create a 100vh navigation menu.When the user first lands on the page they are able to see all the different topics that are listed. As the user scrolls down a 'back to top' button will appear for them to go all the back to the top where the navigation menu is and chose a different topic. For tablet I decided to remove the logo, make the text smaller so it would fit all the links and fixed so the user can access the navigation bar at any time. Although they still have the ability to use to return back to top arrow if they want. This solution was an ease of life implementation and also the user is able to choose what content they want to read first.

I also actively asked friends to review my page and had their thoughts on what could be improved.

#### 2: Ahhh so much content! What to do!?

When seeing all the content I was shocked. I had no idea what I wanted to do with it. How I wanted to lay it out and how would I make it work in terms of only showing content that was necessary to the user. I thought about which content went well together and which content just needed their own page. I decided to gather the history and robin boyd page together. I ran into another issue of how I should display this content. Should I use the same layout for both pages and make them different?

#### Solution

Deciding to put Robin Boyd and History together just made sense to me and many users as Robin Boyd is a part of the history of churchill. I also decided to make the page as simple as possible where on tablet mode for history there are two columns to see the content and photos. While on mobile, it's a one page scroll. However, on my Robin Boyd page i decided to make parallax effect so the user was able to experience something different on the page and not feel like it just another 'history' page.

#### 3:Media Query, Hello? Do you work?

I was constantly testing on all different devices and sometimes I would get confused to why my content was not going to where it should be. I was raging, fuming and screaming. It was frustrating to see a bunch of css code written up and it not doing what it was supposed to be doing.

#### Solution

From a little bit of background knowledge, I decided to deploy this webpage on netlify so I could access it on my phone and iPad. This will then give me real experience with how the website functions rather than seeing it through the computer screen (and hoping for the best). Through this deployment I was able to send link to friends for them to see and do continues deployment for all the changed I made. I was also able to visually see how my website was functioning on the mobile devices which gave me a great insight on what needed improving and what looks good.

I was really happy when I did this it just made my life a bit easier.

### To my future self:

I think next time I really should have a good think about it before even starting development. I mean, yes, the inspiration board helped but I did not put that much effort into actually thinking how I wanted to lay out my pages. I didn't even think to look at what content is being provided and how much content I needed to cover. Next time I should really look at what is being provided first and make a solid judgement from there before even starting to develop and feeling of 'GIRL WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THIS CONTENT? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LAY THIS OUT. OMG. IM DONE'. This then proceeded into to leaving the assignment to a later life problem which then became a feeling of stress because I put it off. NOT A GREAT FEELING.

Also, YouTube is literally the best for guides. I felt so exposed to the front-end web world and how fun it actually is. I really did enjoy doing this assignment and learnt a new skill! I am motivated to continue learning more about web applications and hopefully get into some full stack web development! IMO: I think it was really fun and a field I would love to get into and explore more of it. There is so many resources online for me to continue this journey. :)
