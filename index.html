            Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by
            Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in
            1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boydâ€™s last
            major commission, and he died prior to its completion.

          Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of 
          erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land 
          on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.

          Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
          <ul>
              <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
              <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
          </ul>
