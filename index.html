        <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.</p>

          Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of 
          erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land 
          on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.

          <ul>
              <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
              <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
          </ul>
